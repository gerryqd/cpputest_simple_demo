Just follows below document,

Some change points are,
----------------------

1. The original code cannot be built successfully on my machine.
  (debian8, GCC v4.9)

  Seems that `$(LDFALGS)` is not used at all. After searching on the internet, and found the solution.

  a. put lib used (not in `-l` or '-L` sytle) to `$(LDLIBS)`
  b. remove such kind of libs from `$(LDFLAGS)`

2. Modern CppUTest seems requires the math library, so, `-lm` is added to `$(LDFLAGS)`.
